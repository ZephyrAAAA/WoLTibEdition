Importing macro mechanics, resource gathering, tech tree elements, and other mechanics from Command and Conquer 3 into the Starcraft 2 Wings of Liberty Campaign.

There is now only 1 resource. Most resource fields regrow over time.

Each mission has been looked over, most mineral fields and all vespene geysers have been removed. All vespene resource pickups have been replaced with mineral pickups or removed. Mineral Pickups now give 1000. Resource nodes have been placed in various locations throughout the map, to encourage holding and defending more of it.

Primary Structures now construct buildings, then place then on the map instantly. Workers only harvest resources. Workers harvest multiple times before returning.

Gathered resources are now received by Refineries, allowing cheaper expansions, better fitting into the idea of having more, smaller resource fields.

SCVs are now produced by the Factory. Changes have been made to either start you with one, or you have the ability to build them.

Starting Worker counts have been reduced, as each one is more effective at gathering, and they no longer build.

Units now have Veterancy, gaining up to 3 levels as they kill things. Level 1 and 2 give 10% health and damage each. Level 3 gives an additional 30% health, double attack speed, and health regen.

Supply has been hijacked to be Power instead. Buildings now require it.

Terran Infantry now use a Squad system, where each Squad unit has multiple members.

+ Upgrades have been removed. 

Flat armour has been removed in favour of damage types, so units do damage based on what they are hitting.

Implemented a topbar of Support Powers.
