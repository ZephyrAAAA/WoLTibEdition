Importing macro mechanics, resource gathering, tech tree elements, and other mechanics from Command and Conquer 3 into the Starcraft 2 Wings of Liberty Campaign.

There is now only 1 resource. Resource fields regrow over time.

Each mission has been looked over, and has more resource fields placed on the map, to encourage holding and defending more of it.

Primary Structures now construct buildings, then place then on the map instantly. Workers only harvest resources. Workers harvest multiple times before returning.

Gathered resources are now received by Refineries, allowing cheaper expansions, better fitting into the idea of having more, smaller resource fields.

SCVs are now produced by the Factory. Changes have been made to either start you with one, or you have the ability to build them.

Starting Worker counts have been reduced, as each one is more effective at gathering, and they no longer build.

Units now have Veterancy, gaining up to 3 levels as they kill things. Level 1 and 2 give 10% health and damage each. Level 3 gives an additional 30% health, double attack speed, and health regen.

Supply has been hijacked to be Power instead. Buildings now require it.

Terrqan Infantry now use a Squad system, where each Squad unit has multiple members.

+ Upgrades have been removed.
