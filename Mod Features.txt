Importing macro mechanics, resource gathering, tech tree elements, and other mechanics from Command and Conquer 3 into the Starcraft 2 Wings of Liberty Campaign.

Also rebalancing units and upgrades to make them more viable, and missions to make them better, and better handle the new systems.



There is now only 1 resource. Most resource fields regrow over time.

Each mission has been looked over, most mineral fields and all vespene geysers have been removed. All vespene resource pickups have been replaced with mineral pickups or removed. Mineral Pickups now give 1000. Resource nodes have been placed in various locations throughout the map, to encourage holding and defending more of it.

Primary Structures now construct buildings, then place then on the map instantly. Workers only harvest resources. Workers harvest multiple times before returning.

Gathered resources are now received by Refineries, allowing cheaper/faster expansions, that pay for themselves earlier, better fitting into the idea of having more, smaller resource fields.

SCVs are now produced by the Factory. Changes have been made to either start you with one, or you have the ability to build them.

Starting Worker counts have been reduced, as each one is more effective at gathering, and they no longer build.

Supply has been hijacked to be Power instead. Buildings now require it.

Units and structures now cost resources based on how long they take. 100 minerals per second of buildtime.

Workers harvest resources at roughly 2000/min, under optimal conditions. This means an expansion will pay for itself in under 2 minutes.

Mineral pickups now give 1000 resources.

Vespene pickups now give 2000 resources.

Terran Infantry now use a Squad system, where each Squad unit has multiple members.

+ Upgrades have been removed. 

Flat armour has been removed in favour of damage types, so units do damage based on what they are hitting.

Terrans, starting at Zero Hour, now have access to the Devastation Turret, an anti-armour defensive weapon.
