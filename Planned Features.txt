Importing macro mechanics, resource gathering, tech tree elements, and other mechanics from Command and Conquer 3 into the Starcraft 2 Wings of Liberty Campaign.

Also includes rebalancing missions, units, and upgrades to make them better, more viable, and better handle the new systems.



There is now only 1 resource. Most resource fields regrow over time.

Each mission has been looked over, most mineral fields and all vespene geysers have been removed. All vespene resource pickups have been replaced with mineral pickups or removed. Mineral Pickups now give 1000. Resource nodes have been placed in various locations throughout the map, to encourage holding and defending more of it.

Build radius is now a thing. Buildings must have their center within the radius. Sensor towers provide build radius, and are buildable from a truck from the Command Center.

Primary Structures now construct buildings, then place then on the map instantly. Workers only harvest resources. Workers harvest multiple times before returning.

Gathered resources are now received by Refineries, allowing cheaper/faster expansions, that pay for themselves earlier, better fitting into the idea of having more, smaller resource fields.

SCVs are now produced by the Factory. Changes have been made to either start you with one, or you have the ability to build them.

Starting Worker counts have been reduced, as each one is more effective at gathering, and they no longer build.

Supply has been hijacked to be Power instead. Buildings now require it.

Units and structures now cost resources based on how long they take. 100 minerals per second of buildtime.

Workers harvest resources at roughly 2000/min, under optimal conditions. This means an expansion will pay for itself in under 2 minutes.

Mineral pickups now give 1000 resources.

Vespene pickups now give 2000 resources.

Terran Infantry now use a Squad system, where each Squad unit has multiple members.

+ Upgrades have been removed. 

Flat armour has been removed in favour of damage types, so units do damage based on what they are hitting.

Terrans, starting at Zero Hour, now have access to the Devastation Turret, an anti-armour defensive weapon.

Mercenaries are now a topbar power, with unlimited uses. Mercs are unified into 4 support powers, dropping Infantry, Vehicles, Starships, and Jackson, based on what you've bought. They are unlocked in-mission by building a Spec Ops

Missions have had their attack wave timings offset by a variable amount of time, compared to standard WOL.

You start with 3 protoss research now.

*Units now have Veterancy, gaining up to 3 levels as they kill things. Level 1 and 2 give 10% health and damage each. Level 3 gives an additional 30% health, double attack speed, and health regen.

Implemented a topbar of Support Powers.

You can no longer do all the Zeratul Missions at once. After you've done one, you must do another mission. This does not apply if your only available mission is Char.

Ghosts/Spectres have been reworked to be a unique Commando unit. Ghosts are better at taking down single targets, Spectres are better at Crowd Control. 

Bonus Objectives now generally give something good in-mission.

Shadow Ops is now unlocked after doing 3 missions, Armoury is unlocked after 6, Fusion Core is unlocked after 9.

Reactor Addon has been removed, because of issues with double queues.

Bio units now say an attack line when you tell them to a-move.

All mercs are now unlocked from the start

Progression messages when you return to the Hyperion, and when you start a mission, notifying you of having unlocked the Spec Ops, Predator, Armoury, Hercules, and Fusion Core.

Research bonus objectives now give 10000 credits

Rebalancing of Armoury Upgrade Costs. With the extra money, you can buy everything.

Zeratul now shows up to give Raynor the headache crystal after mission 9, not specifically after The Dig.

Sensor Towers, 2x2 structures, refineries, and bunkers can now be built on creep.

Nodes are now always visible.

Veins are now visible on the minimap.
